/**
 * The course's unit tests: the in-browser compile pipeline, the lesson model and the checks, run
 * in Node against the fake Fabric. `ngNative()` compiles `@ng-native/components` ahead of time as
 * an app's own tests would; the learner's code in these tests is compiled the way the preview
 * compiles it, by `src/learn/preview/program.ts` and Angular's JIT compiler.
 *
 * Sucrase is inlined because its parser is imported from its ES module build, whose relative
 * imports have no file extensions and so only resolve through Vite.
